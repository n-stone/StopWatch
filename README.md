# StopWatch Program 
## 1. Introduction 
- StopWatch is a watch with a hand or a digital display that can be started and stopped at will for exact timing.
- For a watch that has water resistance, a 12/24-hour format display, a full auto-calendar, a daily alarm, and a stopwatch in addition to a fully functioning calculator, thatâ€™s a pretty good deal and gift for almost anyone.
